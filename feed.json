And the other day when I saw Openai's Sora, I told my friend \"it kind of defeats the point of doing what I'm working on.\" Now that I swallowed it, my ideas are clearer. No, not at all.</p>\n<p>What I do is <em>semantics</em>, <em>understanding</em>. It reaches from a declared 3D scene all the way down to actual grounded understanding of a situation. And that is something.</p>\n<p>The Semantify3D project is about about making meaning - not colours, or sounds, but meaning itself - live and deployed in a 3D space, in time.</p>\n<p>I'm now using <a href=\"https://wails.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wails</a>, from Lea Anthony. It basically offers a fast &amp; clean Golang backend, behind a familiar and comfortably beautiful HTML/CSS/JS frontend. I'm working on a side-project that's ideal for getting acquainted with that tool, a 3D version of Nine Men's Morris I've been working on for some years. I'll post a link if I ever get satisfied with it.<a href=\"https://wails.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a></p>",

Instead, I'll rely on views, which are selections of workspaces that the user wants to see simultaneously.</p>\n<p>I've added a small command line at the bottom of the screen for power users (e.g., me). Everything should be doable from UI elements alone, and from the command line alone. It should also be possible to create custom commands. Hitting the spacebar gives you instant focus on the command line, and you're ready to type in.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's now a toolbar at the top of the screen. It's meant to provide quick access to different toolboxes in the left-hand side panel. I thought it would be handy to always have it on screen.</p>\n<p>For both the command line and the toolbar, I used the excellent css library <a href=\"http://augmented-ui.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">augmented-ui</a> to get those nice diagonal shapes. All in all, the entire thing doesn't look as futuristic as I was planning, but it's still easy on the eye so, I'm satisfied.</p>",

I've been experimenting for 2 weeks, and now have a UI draft that looks how I want it to.</p>\n<p>When I work with complex softwares, I always struggle with the UI to find what I need, because the controls are scattered all around the central area, and often hidden behind menus or dropdowns. Here, I decided to put every control in a panel on the left-hand side of the screen, because I find it easier to merely scroll until I get what I'm looking for.</p>\n<p>Then the main area is occupied by workspaces, ready to receive code editors, graphs or 3D visualizers, editable markdown viewers, ...etc. There again, the user just have to scroll in order to reach them.</p>\n<p>My idea is that of a Jupyter style notebook, but in the shape of an outliner. An outliner is basically a recursively folding container, and I don't have that implemented yet. It might be my next move.</p>",
