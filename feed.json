Indeed, the value part of a table was accepting lists of items, for example <code>| 1 2 3 | 4 5 6  </code> but the meaning was unclear.

Other operators won't need a lot of work, so I'm rather focusing on the other part of the loop, the feedback. To implement feedback, I want source code generation to be comments and newlines aware. So I'll modify the parser to make a \"shape aware\" version of it. Basically, everything in tables' values will be wiped out (because how would I choose where each comment would survive), and everything else will stay the same. The only thing I'll keep from values is whether they are all on the same line, or each on a line of its own.</p>\n<p>I can feel the part of me that doesn't want to go further. It's not happy.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I could look at my design and call it a day, but there's one thing I'm definitely not satisfied with.</p>\n<p>Hup is all oriented towards the description of high-level \"mental\" operations. You can't parse a string of characters, or even just print a mere \"hello world\" to the screen. (Well yeah, you can.) But where Hup shines is elsewhere. It's vastly superior to any kind of supercharged Behavior Tree I've seen here and there, even to <a href=\"https://plexil-group.github.io/plexil_docs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plexil</a>, and it's so friendly and pragmatic compared to Prolog. So clearly this is our target here, high-level stuff, mental behaviors themselves.</p>\n<p>But Hup's weakness, as it is today, is metaprogramming. Sure you can have tables generating tables on the fly, and you can also switch from state-thinking to event-thinking using the natural recursion capability of formulas. But it doesn't mean it would be easy to write programs that evolve, and I don't like it. I want more.</p>\n<p>Let me explain what we can do now. We can have tables which generate values which are other tables. These other tables are first class citizens too, no problem. Another thing we can do is using recursion to make values evolve over time by themselves, for example <code>[ one more = [one more] 1 | 1 ]</code> would keep adding ones to its list of values.</p>\n<p>But meta is another thing entirely. It's about structural, it's about runtime mutation. I don't know. I have this idea of \"meta-tables\" in the back of my head for some time now. A meta-table would obviously contain data about a regular table. I don't know if <em>that</em> idea of meta-tables and <em>this</em> desire of metaprogramming are somehow related. All I know is that I'm not done yet.</p>",

So I have a basic structure that now works correctly, and while the UI code is all wild and organic, the engine code is well structured and commented JSDoc style. Programming \"correctly\" is surprisingly more error prone than my natural code-fu, but I finally eradicated all those nasty little bugs.</p>\n<p>Now, the structure is as follows. Tables are associated with spaces, and names. Names are not unique to tables. Several tables can have the same name, that's why a table is identified by a generic ID and a name is a set of IDs of tables that share that name. Same goes for spaces, since spaces contain tables. The purpose of names and spaces are different though: names are how a table references other tables in a formula, while spaces form a logical partition of data in Hup, mainly for communication with the outer world.</p>\n<p>Spaces are either \"exposed\" or not. Exposed spaces are the ones that are visible outside the engine. This is where you'd plug any external devices, and where the UI is connected. Exposed means, \"read/write accessible from the outside.\"</p>\n<p>For now, you register callback functions to expose a space, then when the tables in that space change, the callback is called, either with a text version of the content, or with the AST. Simple.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">On the FUI front, I had some sort of revelation the other day. UIs always have either light or dark modes, but perhaps it would be interesting to get past this. The content would be dark mode, but the container would be light mode, in shades of white and grey, white for unoccupied screen areas, grey for grouping contents. Lines and shapes would be diagonal where appropriate. </span><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">It's worth a try.</span></p>\n<p>Do not try to bend the spoon. I tried this light&amp;dark thing and it was ugly as hell. Then I understood that my UI was meant to disappear behind the user's UI. The user-developer would setup a frontend, with Hup as the backend. Then the user-users (the users of the user-developer's app) wouldn't see Hup's UI, unless they hit F12 or something, to have a look behind the curtain. They'd see the frontend of the user-developer's app. And <em>that</em> spoon isn't my business.</p>",
